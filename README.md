This is a compiler project!

It consists of implementing a simple compiler for the so called LITTLE programming language. 

The LITTLE language is a toy programming language designed solely for this course and it is based (however different!) on the MICRO language described in the course text book.

The project is written in C++ using lex and Yacc.
